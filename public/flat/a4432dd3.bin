Welcome to BitBox!

This is a custom buildroot running inside the V86 emulator. 
It has been tweaked to be as fast as possible and has the following packages installed:

busybox utilities
sudo
ash (default shell)
ascii_invaders (shooting game)
pfetch (recommended)
static-get (package manager - not recommended for larger packages)
...

You CAN LOAD your own files into the /home/daiplg directory by using the "glowing"
folder icon in bottom left corner of the screen.
